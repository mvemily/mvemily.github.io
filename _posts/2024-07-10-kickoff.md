It’s time to (officially) get this party started! That’s why I’m inviting you to a Campaign Kickoff on Saturday, July 27th, from 1-3pm at the home of one of my Mountain View neighbors and biggest supporters.

We’ll be joined by two leaders who have inspired my public service, Former State Controller Betty Yee and State Senator Josh Becker. Please RSVP ahead of time to get the address!
