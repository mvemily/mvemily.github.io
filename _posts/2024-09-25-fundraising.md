I'm excited to announce that we have raised up to the city's Voluntary Expenditure Limit! That means we have the money we need to win this race.  
    
Adopted in 2000 with a 3% annual increase, Mountain View's [Voluntary Expenditure Limit (aka VEL)](https://library.municode.com/ca/mountain_view/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIITHCO_CH2AD_ARTXIICAFI_DIV3VOEXLI) was designed to attract qualified candidates by allowing them to spend less time fundraising and more time engaging with voters on the issues that matter. This system has helped keep local elections focused on our city and reduced the influence of money in politics, which aligns with my previous work on campaign finance policies.  
   
I cannot truly express my gratitude to the 168 donors who helped us reach this milestone. Because I believe in grassroots engagement and campaign finance transparency, I am thrilled to report that:  
- Majority of the donations came from women;  
- Nearly 3 in 4 donors were from Santa Clara County; and  
- Two thirds of donors gave $100 or less!  
  
Your donations will go directly to contacting voters with our message, and we are ramping up our efforts in the final 41 days of the campaign to ensure I can continue to serve our community.  
  
With that in mind, I hope you will join us to knock doors, call voters, display a yard sign, or host a house party. [Sign up today!](https://emilyannramos.com/join-us/) I would love to see you soon on the campaign trail.  
  
Thank you for your help and support!
